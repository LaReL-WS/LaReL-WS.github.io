## Submission Instructions

Submissions can be made at [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=ICML.cc/2020/Workshop/LaReL).

The submissions should be anonymised 4-page papers (excluding references and supplementary materials), in a form of a single pdf created using [ICML 2020 style](https://media.icml.cc/Conferences/ICML2020/Styles/icml2020_style.zip) and following [author instructions](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2020/StyleAuthorInstructions) where applicable. Note that you will need to have a registered account with OpenReview. The reviews will be double-blind, with at least two reviewers assigned to each paper. 

The papers should report original research, provide synthesis of previous works or develop novel environments. The work published or scheduled to be published has to be substantially extended in order to be considered for the workshop. We do welcome concise versions of parallel submissions to other conferences, such as NeurIPS and EMNLP. We discourage submitting to multiple ICML workshops. 

All accepted papers will be available on the workshop website, but no formal workshop proceedings will be published. The prizes will be available to the winners of the best paper award.

For any questions, email us at [larel2020@googlegroups.com](mailto:larel2020@googlegroups.com).
